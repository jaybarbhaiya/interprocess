//! Socket control message manipulation.
//!
//! This module contains a generic safe framework for control messages â€“ not just for Unix domain sockets, but for any `recvmsg`/`sendmsg`-based API in the Unix socket architecture.
//!
//! The [`ancillary`] module contains safe wrappers that can help you correctly initialize and parse ancillary data control messages; its types can then be fed into [`CmsgBuffer`] or [`CmsgMut`] via the `.add_message()` method on both of those structs.
// TODO parser

/// The type encodes the memory safety of the control message with the specified level, type and payload being sent, in the form of a safety guarantee. It intentionally does not implement [`Copy`] and [`Clone`] because control messages, as exemplified by [`ancillary::FileDescriptors`], can transfer ownership over resources, which requires that only move semantics be provided.
